MySQL DB --> 3306 port number
Backend  --> 8080
Frontend --> 80 


DB SG Rule
---------------------
Don't give 0.0.0.0/0 or vpc CIDR --> in MySQL 3306

Should be like this: Allow traffic on 3306 from the instance which are attached to expense-dev-backend-sg

SSM:  provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data management and secrets management.
--> Why we need SSM (Systems Manager) -> AWS --> Parameter Store --> Create

Use:
We have 01_VPC, 02_SG to get data from 1 -> Like VPC_ID, Subnet_ID Store in SSM
